storylines
==========

This is a collaborative story telling app. Users can either start a new story or add a line to another story, but the catch is they can only see the previous entry. Once a story gets a certain number of entries, the story is added to a list of "complete" stories and everyone can read them.

I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails, and the purpose of writing this app was to have fun and practice code!
