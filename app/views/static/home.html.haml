      %h4 Then other people continue the story by adding one new line at a time. The catch is they only get to see the title and the previous line that was written. Let chaos ensue!

        %h3 The Curious Cat
        %p One day, Chester the Cat was playing around in the bushes when all of the sudden he saw a giant mouse! He never saw a mouse before, but was quite curious about it. Since he had never seen a mouse, the cat tried to touch it with his paw. Unfortunately, mice don't like being touched, let's just say that kitty only has 3 paws now. With his new disability, Chester realized that he would have to change many aspects about his life. Chester rapidly became depressed, knowing that all of these life changes would be very difficult, so he began eating too much and died of complications from morbid obesity.
